- In the Article Percieved Peer and Teacher Goals, they talk about percieved goals compared to individual goals. Perceived goals would be that someone wants to do something like in family how my brother wants to be done university compared to something like in gambling like I hope that Fanduel doesn't go down. Its mainly the difference between wanting and hoping. What I have understood from the article was that percieved goals are mainly education based compared to individual goals where you can set non-educational goals where you hope something will go right for you in the future.
